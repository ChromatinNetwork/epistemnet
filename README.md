# EpiStemNet

EpiStemNet provides 20 comprehensive networks of epigenomic co-location relationships, occurring in different chromatin states, derived from a collection of 139 previously described assays including ChIP-Seq, MeDIP and GLIB analysis in mESC. Different chromatin states provide a regulatory framework functioning as epigenomic binding platforms that conditions the binding of Chromatin related Proteins (CrPs). We derive 20 chromatin state-specific networks of direct co-locations involving epigenomic features including 3 types of cytosine modifications (5mC, 5hmC and 5fC), 13 histone marks and 61 CrPs including the ESC master regulators Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2. These networks are robust global maps of the location interdependence of the different epigenomic features that considers a comprehensive compilation of key players in a variety of epigenomic processes in ESCs.
