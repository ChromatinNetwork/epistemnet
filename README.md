# EpiStemNet

EpiStemNet provides a comprehensive network of epigenomic co-location relationships derived from a collection of 139 previously described assays including ChIP-Seq, MeDIP and GLIB analysis in mESC. We derived the network of direct co-locations involving epigenomic features including 3 types of cytosine modifications (5mC, 5hmC and 5fC), 13 histone marks and 61 CrPs including the ESC master regulators Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2. This network is a robust global map of the location interdependence of the different epigenomic features that considers a comprehensive compilation of key players in a variety of epigenomic processes in ESCs.
